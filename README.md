This is my first repository I have created on GitHub and I am trying to get it straight... 

##How does it work?
I'd like to know that as well.

Here is a link to a list of instructions on how to write this readme file: 
https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/

The first step is to create a repository on GitHub or go to an existing one.

Then you can select "Clone in Desktop" and map the repository to a local directory on your
hard drive.

Then you need to go to Visual Studio and in order to be able to open a project from the files
you got from the repository, do New -> Project from existing code. Choose the directory you 
have mapped right before. Give a name to the project and select C# as the project type
(the other 2 are also ok if we are modifying an existing repository)

Now we are ready to do some changes. Create a branch and change for example the readme file. 

Then go to Changes (inside visual studio) enter a comment for the commit, then do Commit.
